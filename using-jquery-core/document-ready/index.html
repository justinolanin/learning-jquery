<!--01. Explain which of the following will load first and why.

The document ready will load first; it is excuted when the DOM tree is built but does not wait for things
like loading large files. The window onload will wait for the page to be fully loaded including inner frames and images.
To test this out I added and image at the bottom of the page. I can see the document ready show in console, then the image
on the page, then the window onload in console.

*Use document ready when you have a large amount of files (images, ads, scripts) so it does
not consume a large amoount of time. Use window onload when you have less amount of stuff

-->

<!--02. Explain what must be completed before the document ready function is executed.

The document ready function will run when the HTML is ready, but before images and other resources have finished.
This is the soonest time that you can change the DOM with JavaScript

-->

<!--03. Explain what must be completed before the widow on load function is executed.

The window onload will run after everything has loaded including images

This will load a function when the document is loaded. I added an image at the bottom of the page. I can see in the console log that document ready shows first, then the image shows, then the window onload shows. For this example I have it logging to the console but the code is;
<pre>
  $(document).ready(function() {
      console.log("This is the document loaded log.");
  });
</pre>
<script>
  $(document).ready(function() {
      console.log("This is the document loaded log.");
  });
</script>

<font size="+2"><I><pre>$(window).on("load", function()</pre></I></font>
This will load a function when the window is loaded. For this example I have it logging to the console but the code is;
<pre>
  $(window).on("load", function() {
      console.log("This is my log for the window.onload function example");
  });
</pre>
<script>
  $(window).on("load", function() {
      console.log("This is my log for the window.onload function example");
